Introduction
============

SMOL is an imperative, object-oriented research language.  SMOL integrates
semantic web technologies and numerical simulation blocks, and can serve as a
test bed for creating digital twins.

Semantic Web Technologies and SMOL
----------------------------------

SMOL supports *semantic lifting* of program state: objects and their fields
are represented as :term:`RDF` triples and can be processed via standard semantic web
technologies like :term:`SPARQL`.  An external ontology can be used to give additional
semantics to the lifted program state.  Section :ref:`semantic-access` describes this in detail.

Co-Simulation and SMOL
----------------------

Dynamic simulation model components (:term:`FMU`\ s) that follow the `FMI
standard <https://fmi-standard.org>`_ can be directly integrated into SMOL
code.  A SMOL program can drive the dynamic model inputs and controls the
advancement of time for all FMUs, and can access the dynamic model outputs,
making them available for semantic lifting.  This is discussed further in
Section :ref:`fmos`.
