Digital Twins Introduction: Concepts and Engineering Perspectives
=================================================================

Digital twins are an emerging, enabling technology for industry to transition to
the next level of digitisation.

They are meant to **understand and control assets in nature**, in industry and in 
society at large.

They were originally conceived at NASA for the space program, they have emerged 
as an engineering discipline, based on best practices.


What is a digital twin
----------------------

.. admonition:: NASA's definition of a DT
    :class: Note

    "an integrated multi-physics, multi-scale, probabilistic simulation
    of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models,
    sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its flying
    twin. It is ultra-realistic and may consider one or more important
    and interdependent vehicle systems"

A Digital Twin (DT) is a **live replica** of a Physical System (Physical Twin, PT).
DT is **connected to PT in near real-time** via data-streams (e.g. by sensors). 
DT takes information from the PT, uses them to do observations and take 
decisions/actions to be performed on the PT.

A Digital Twin integrates aspects of models and control systems.

Lifecycle Management
----------------------

Digital Thread: The digital twin is meant to **adapt**, as the underlying assets evolve with time. It **evolves in tandem** with the asset.

This allows to:

#. Connect the **designs, requirements and software** that go into the system represented by the DT
#. Connect the **different phases of the system to the DT**: design, development, operation, decommissioning, . . .
    * The DT **accompanies and adapts** to the evolution of a system in all its phases

Thus proposing a new Software Engineering (SE) paradigm:

* **Models are an integrated part of the system**, as they are also used in SE phases following the system design phase.
* The purpose of the system is **building software to maintain models**, instead of building models to maintain software.
* Changes in the assets trigger **model evolutions**.
* **CPS in-the-large**: distributed, heterogeneous

Conceptual Layers of a Digital Twin
-----------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/conceptual-layers.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Conceptual Layers

There are four conceptual layers that constituite a Digital Twin:

- **Descriptive:** Insight into the past ("what happened?" scenarios)
- **Predictive:** Understanding the future ("what may happen?" scenarios)
- **Prescriptive:** Advise on possible outcomes ("what if?" scenarios)
- **Reactive:** Automated decision making

Digital Twins and Formal Methods
--------------------------------

.. 
    TODO: ask about which tool is actually used (Coq, Agda...)

Role of Formal Methods in DT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Conceptual clearness, semantics, compositionality
- Ensure **correctness**
- Better *tool support*
- Beyond simulation: evaluate or predict worst-cases, what-if scenarios, etc...

Role of Knowledge Representation in DT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A DT can be seen as composed by a Structural Twin which uniformly **represent knowledge** about PT and DT
- **Reasoning support** that can exploit this knowledge
- Allows **correctness properties** to be expressed as **relations** between PT and DT


The Semantically Reflected Digital Twin
---------------------------------------

Now we see an example of a digital twin architecture
description using formal methods based on three technologies
techniques.
This is based on the use of the following tools:

**SWT**: Semantic Web Technologies for uniform **knowledge representation** and **integration** of domain knowledge (discussed later).

**FMI**: The Functional Mock-Up Interface **standard for interfaces between PT and DT**, as well as simulations (discussed later).

**SMOL**: **Semantic Reflection** to reason about PT and DT through the integration of SWT and FMI into a programming language (discussed later). The system is implemented in **SMOL**, a unique language designed specifically for integration of SWT and programming.

Example: House heating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example for a digital twin architecture can be made for an house with a heating system.

A DT can be divided into:

* **Structural Twin**: formed by
    * Asset model:
        * **Domain knowledge**: a connection between all the "parts" of the house (rooms, heaters, walls) to represent the concept of "House" as long as the simulators for each part.
        * **Instance**: a specific instance of the domain knowledge for a particular house.
    * **Twin model**:
        * **Domain & Instance**: instance of the domain knowledge for the behavioral twin

* **Behavioral Twin**: formed by
    * **Digital twin infrastructure**: which coordinates the simulation of all the units (parts of the house).
    * **Twin configuration**: which control the **coupled** simulation of all the units (parts of the house), hence the relations between different simulations.
