Modelling Knowledge using Semantic Technologies
===============================================

Semantic Technologies
----------------------

Knowledge can be described ad hoc or in a structural manner. Semantic Technologies facilitate the description of **structured knowledge, consistency checking and reasoning**.

Some of this technologies which are also W3C standars are:

* For data: **RDF** (Resource Description Framework)
* For knowledge: **OWL** (Web Ontology Language)
* For queries: **SPARQL** (an RDF query language)


RDF (Resource Description Framework)
-------------------------------------

In the semantic technology context (and in particular in RDF), data is expressed by triples (facts), which consists of a *subject*, a *predicate* and an *object*.

Example:

.. figure:: /images/rdf-example.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: RDF example

Alice (id 111) is a Person. She has a child named Bob (id 222) who is also a Person. Bob has a child named Charlie (id 333) who is also a Person.

Here we see multiple facts, each of which is a triple. The subject is the entity that is being described (Alice id 111), the predicate is the property of the subject (having a child), and the object is the value of the property (Bob id 111).


OWL (Web Ontology Language)
---------------------------

It's a **knowledge representation** language used to build ontologies.

- Ontologies are **logics** for **knowledge representation**

The following is a simple example of an ontology in OWL. Since it express knowledge in a formal way it can be represented also in logical form.

.. figure:: /images/owl-example.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OWL example

.. math::
    \forall x \: \exists y \: \exists z \: | \: hasChild(x, y) \: \land \: hasChild(y, z) \: \land \: Person(z) \: \implies \: GrandParent(x)


``hasChild`` **some** (``hasChild`` **some** ``Person``) **subClassOf** ``GrandParent``

- Ontologies represent knowledge that is incremented over time

SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)
-----------------------------------------------

**SPARQL** is a **query** language for databases stored in RDF format. 

.. figure:: /images/owl-example.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OWL example

.. code-block:: sparql
    
    SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x a :Person }
    SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a :Person. ?x :hasChild ?y }
    SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x a :GrandParent }

Asset modelling
---------------

.. admonition:: **Asset model in the engineering domain**
    :class: note

    An asset model is an **organized, digital description** of the composition and properties of an **asset**.

* In the engineering domain it is common practice to **build asset models** to support, e.g., maintenance, operations, design etc...
* There are currently several industry initiatives that endorse the use of **ontologies** for asset modelling, e.g., in the Industry 4.0

.. admonition:: **Asset models & digital twins**
    :class: note

    Assets models are any **object of interest** in a digital twin. They provide the twin with **knowledge** about the **static structure** that can be **used for the twinâ€™s simulation model**

The next example is the **modelling of an house** by exploiting semantic technologies illustrated before.
We can create a **representation** of the house (in all his parts) by the means of **RDF** triples.
In this way there is a **formal** representation of it that can be **interpreted/understood** by a computer in order to obtain meaningful information from it.

House Asset Use Case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/house-asset-use-case.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: House Asset Use Case

| Download the house asset model from: https://github.com/smolang/SemanticObjects/blob/master/examples/tutorialfiles.zip
| File: house.ttl

The architecture of the house expressed here:

..
    TODO add image from demo_day1 slide 61 (first image)

Is expressed in RDF format (Turtle syntax) as follows:

..
    TODO add image from demo_day1 slide 61 (second image)

Example of SPARQL in SMOL
-------------------------

The following is an example of the usage of SPARQL in SMOL code.

It selects the ids of all the rooms represented in the house asset model and print them out.

.. code-block::

    main
        List<Int> results = access(
            "SELECT ?obj {
                ?a a asset:Room.
                ?a asset:id ?obj
            }";
        )
        while results != null do
            Int current = results.content;
            results = results.next;
            println(current);
        end
    end
