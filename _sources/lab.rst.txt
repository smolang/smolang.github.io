Digital Twin Lab
================

The SMOL team is managing the Digital Twin lab at the University of Oslo (Lab Room 8270, OJD), a laboratory for exploring software for Digital Twins directly on physical setups, financed by the Institute of Informatics.

The laboratory is currently containing one greenhouse, which contains several basilikum plants, which are pair-wise connected to water pumps.
A SMOL controller software, connected to the sensors of the plants through InfluxDB, and using an asset model as the underlying knowledge graph is used to ensure
correct watering of the plants. An article describing the greenhouse is accepted for publication at `SEAMS 2024 <https://conf.researchr.org/home/seams-2024>`_.

You can find a detailed description `here <https://github.com/sievericcardo/GreenHouseDT>`_ .
The used VM for the greenhouse can be downloaded `here <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10561309>`_, the used images for the Raspberry Pi's `here (collector) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10561495>`_ and here `here (actuator) <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10561649>`_.

This page will be and extended updated as the laboratory grows:
We are currently extending the laboratory with a `mirte robot <https://mirte.org>`_, a fermentation station and an `incubator <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10390>`_
